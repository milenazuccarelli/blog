Around the middle of summer every year is when I become increasingly desperate for autumn to arrive. So I decided to make a list of my favourite shows from the fw17.  

A.P.C
---------------------

A.P.C’s founder Jean Touitou introduced this collection expressing his slight bit of disappointment with the way ready-to-wear seems to be becoming increasingly extravagant and less… ready to wear: "In those days, it was very different—you would show clothes that were meant to be sold. Now, it's become more concept, and ready-to-wear is not made to be worn anymore." What I like about A.P.C. is exactly that — just how wearable and simple it really is, with a few twists here and there of course, such as the role reversal of jackets being worn as shirts, tucked into jeans, or as an accessory, knotted behind the shoulders.

Calvin Klein
---------------------

Raf Simons’ debut for Calvin Klein was an interpretation of sleek american aesthetic, from tailoring to colour blocking. He commissioned artist Ruby Sterling to design the set of the show and imagine what America would look like in an installation. “It reflects what’s around us. All these different people, with different styles and dress codes. It’s the future, the past, art deco, the city, the American west. All and none of these, it isn’t an era, or a thing, it’s not one look. It is the union of different characters and different individuals, just like America itself. It is the unique beauty and feeling of America.”

Celine
---------------------

I really like the slightly more masculine than usual silhouettes, super cool along with those leather hoods and trench coats which create some sort of utilitarian mood here and there.

Margaret Howell
---------------------

Margaret Howell just does classic items really well, with the perfect balance between slouchy and tailored, oversized and fitted. The styling seems stripped back and essential in the best way possible, every piece has its place - nothing about it seems superfluous and overworked. (measure is a good word)

R13
---------------------

Shirts worn backwards, saw this in Roberto Rodriguez as well 

{% include slider.html selector="five" %}

Rick Owens
---------------------

It’s hard to look past the hat-masks, and this show was more on the conceptual side of ready-to-wear, but there were some interesting details and the are shoes, of course, always enjoyable.

Samuji
---------------------

Samu-Jussi Koski is my one of my favourite designers at the moment, the brand is just so clean and minimal and so well made. As I had them saved as well, I accidentally uploaded the images from his spring collection so I’ll just talk about it instead as I like it better than his fw anyway. The inspiration behind this one was Oskar Schlemmer’s Triadic Ballet — the Bauhaus Ballet, which translates in the crumpled fabrics, bright prints (not pictured), geometric patterns and a colour palette that ranges from blues to summery terra cottas. I was lucky enough to cop an orange-copper Italian linen vest in the sales, for 60 percent off the original price (and free shipping) and it’s just so beautiful.

A few B-sides from A to Z.
---------------------

<ul>
    <li>
        A — <u>Aalto</u> had a burgundy suit colour blocked with a bright yellow-orange polo neck. There was some interesting patchwork going on, two colourful and circular on the jacket and black rectangles along the thighs of the trousers.
    </li>
    <li>
        B — I liked how everything was pulled and wrapped in the <u>Balenciaga</u> show, there was one look which I particularly liked which was an oversized, forest green puffy jacket, slighty pulled towards the side and buttoned towards the top. It had a matching green hood/headscarf, a look that reminded me a lot of Stella Mccartney's.
    </li>
    <li>
        C — What I liked about <u>Casely Hayford</u> was layering and deconstruction (especially in the shoes), and played on items worn unconventionally, such as a jacket worn as a jacket, but wrapped horizontally instead of vertically.
    </li>
    <li>
        C — <u>Cedric Charlier</u> had an interesting take on layering and colour blocking, but honestly most of it fell flat for me.
    </li>
    <li>
        C — <u>Creatures of Comfort</u> were using sweaters in the most interesting ways, from belts to scarves. I really like this idea, becuase it's a nice alternative for a scarf which is the accessory (yet necessity) that I detest the most.
    </li>
    <li>
        D — <u>Diesel</u> had a femme-fatale all black look that layered a sleeveless-blazer dress over a polo neck that was super cool paired with a pair of white and grey Margiela-esque trainers.
    </li>
    <li>
        M — <u>Michael Cors</u> also seemed to be using sweaters as scarves, in on look a forest green sweater and a brown houndstooth tailored jacket that had some sort of grandpa/hunter feel, with a nice detail of striped cuffs comeing out from the shirt undearneath. 
    </li>
    <li>
        N — <u>Noir Kei Ninomiya</u>, I hadn't heard of this designer before but I like the explicit Commes Des Garcons references. But honestly what really bugged me about this show was the casting of the models. 
    </li>
    <li>
        P — <u>Public School</u> had one or two interesting looks that played on tailoring, layering and deconstruction.
    </li>
    <li>
        S — <u>Sacai</u> showed that had vertical ruffling and trimmings in different fabrics over a white and light blue pinstripe shirt dress, pleated towards the bottem with zip openings that created for a nice deconstructed silhouette, at the risk of sounding super pretentious.  
    </li>
</ul>

Commes Des Garcons Commes Des Garcons, certainly not a B-side but just deserves a post of its own.
